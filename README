README for buildgcov
====================

This set of files is used to build a gcov(1) enabled version of perl-current.

The main script is "buildgcov.sh" and does all the work in a number of steps:

    1) rsync the source-tree
    2) Configure perl for gcov (with -Dextras=Devel::Cover)
    3) build perl.gcov
    4) run the test-suit with -MDevel::Cover
    5) gather all *.gcov files and convert with gcov2perl
    6) run Devel::Cover's cover to craete the report
    7) create a stand-alone archive of the coverage and build reports

    8) push the archive to my web-server
